# Horizons-SLM

### Welcome to The Horizons Sober Living Management GitHub!

**What is Horizons SLM?**

The sober and treatment grow exponentialy every single day. The sober living home community is apart of this growth, but is a somewhat ignored business sector. There are countless
EMR SaaS providers for your typical in-patient rehab and out-patient (PHP/IOP). The problem is that they are not expressly made for sober living facilities. 

They either lack in their features or flat-out don't support operational needs of sober living homes. Horizons SLM/EMR is pre-seed and looking for partners that want to come
and join the effort by making a buy-in investment or contributing substantially to the project. 

This will be a very lucrative and successful product with thousands of potential customers for a steady SaaS income stream. I am a very motivated individual, and I invite anyone
that is interested to reach out on here or https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghkwhite/
